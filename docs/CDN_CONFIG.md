# CDN Configuration Example

# This is a sample configuration for using jsDelivr as a CDN for your static assets.
# For a custom CDN, you would need to upload your assets to a provider like Cloudflare, AWS S3 + CloudFront, or Netlify.

# Example: Using jsDelivr for public assets

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pJulianV/comercio_negocios_latam_sac@main/js/script.js

# Steps for a custom CDN:
1. Choose a CDN provider (Cloudflare, AWS, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Upload your static files (css, js, img, etc.) to the CDN.
3. Update your HTML to reference the CDN URLs for assets.
4. Verify cache and performance improvements.

# For production, update your asset links in HTML to use the CDN URLs.
